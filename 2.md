DuckDuckGo is a privacy-focused search engine committed to providing anonymous, secure search services without tracking users' search histories or personal information.

## Features

- **Privacy Protection:** DuckDuckGo does not track users' search histories or personal information, ensuring anonymity and privacy.
  
- **Search Functionality:** It offers search features similar to other search engines, including web search, image search, video search, etc.

- **Open Source:** Some parts of DuckDuckGo's code are open source, allowing people to review its workings and privacy protection mechanisms.

## Usage

- **Privacy Advocates:** DuckDuckGo is an excellent choice for users concerned about their privacy since it doesn't track search histories or personal information.

- **Researchers:** DuckDuckGo provides unbiased search results by not customizing them based on individual preferences, making it a useful tool for researchers.

- **Sensitive Topic Searches:** For searches involving sensitive topics where users may not want their search history tracked, DuckDuckGo is a good option.

## How to use
**Intall**
```
pip install -U duckduckgo_search
```
search text:
```
from duckduckgo_search import DDGS
results = DDGS().text("python programming", max_results=5)
print(results)
```
but when you use a Proxy, you should set it.
```
ddgs = DDGS(proxy="http://localhost:7891", timeout=20)
```
the '7891' is your Proxy Port.
