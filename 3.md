# Fastai Limitations
## ![Image text](https://img.shields.io/badge/Limitations-grey?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript)

- **Excessive Encapsulation:** Fastai suffers from excessive encapsulation, making it difficult for users to directly modify the model. For example, extracting features from a specific layer can be challenging.

- **Insufficient Documentation:** The documentation provided by Fastai lacks basic information. Users may find it challenging to perform simple tasks such as modifying batch size as it's not clearly documented in the official documentation or code.

- **GPU Memory Management:** When using GPU, Fastai's memory cleanup is not always thorough, leading to memory fragmentation and affecting subsequent processing speed.
