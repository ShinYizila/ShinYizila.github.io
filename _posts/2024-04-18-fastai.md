- **High-Level APIs:** Fastai offers high-level abstractions and pre-built components for common deep learning tasks such as image classification, natural language processing, and tabular data analysis.

- **Model Training:** It simplifies the process of training deep learning models by providing easy-to-use APIs for model creation, training, and evaluation.

- **Pre-trained Models:** Fastai comes with pre-trained models for various tasks, allowing users to quickly fine-tune them on their own datasets.

- **Data Augmentation:** It includes built-in support for data augmentation techniques, helping improve model generalization and performance.

- **Integrated Learning:** Fastai integrates cutting-edge research findings into its library, making it easy for users to experiment with the latest advancements in deep learning.

## Usage

1. **Installation:** Fastai can be installed via pip or conda. 
    ```
    pip install fastai
    ```

2. **Importing:** Import the necessary modules from fastai to start using its functionalities.
    ```python
    from fastai.vision import *
    ```

3. **Model Training:** Define your model architecture, prepare your data using `DataLoaders`, and train your model using `Learner`.
    ```python
    learn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet34, metrics=accuracy)
    learn.fine_tune(4)
    ```

4. **Inference:** Once trained, use the trained model for inference on new data.
    ```python
    preds,_ = learn.get_preds(dl=test_dl)
    ```
5. **Not Use GPU**
   ```python
   import os
   os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES']=-1
   ```
