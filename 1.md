# Fingerprint Recognition and System Establishment

Fingerprint recognition is a biometric authentication technology based on the uniqueness of each person's fingerprints. The main steps include **<span style="color:red">collection</span>**, **<span style="color:red">feature extraction</span>**, and **<span style="color:red">matching</span>**. The specific principles are as follows:

1. ![]( https://img.shields.io/badge/Fingerprint%20Image%20Acquisition-8A2BE2)  :Firstly, fingerprint images are collected through sensors. This is typically done using optical sensors, capacitive sensors, or ultrasonic sensors. Fingerprint image acquisition involves having the user place their finger on the sensor.

2.  ![]( https://img.shields.io/badge/Feature%20Extraction-8A2BE2) The collected fingerprint images are digitized and then undergo feature extraction algorithms to extract key feature points. These feature points may include ridge endings, bifurcations, and ridge lines. The extracted feature points are used to create a unique fingerprint template.

4. ![]( https://img.shields.io/badge/Fingerprint%20Matching-8A2BE2) Once fingerprint features are extracted, the system compares them with registered fingerprint templates stored in a database. The matching process usually involves algorithms to calculate the similarity between two fingerprint templates. If the similarity exceeds a certain threshold, the two are considered a match, thus verifying the user's identity.

5. ![]( https://img.shields.io/badge/Authentication/Identification-8A2BE2)**<span style="color:red">:</span>** Finally, based on the matching result, the system performs the corresponding action. If the match is successful, the system authenticates the user's identity or identifies the user. Otherwise, the user is denied access or needs to undergo additional verification steps.

Additionally, these methods are encapsulated to establish a fingerprint recognition system. This system can batch add fingerprints and compare fingerprint similarities.

Throughout the process, fingerprint recognition systems rely on the uniqueness and stability of fingerprints. Since each person's fingerprint pattern is unique, fingerprint recognition is widely used in security applications such as unlocking smartphones and access control systems.

DuckDuckGo is a privacy-focused search engine committed to providing anonymous, secure search services without tracking users' search histories or personal information.

## Features

- **Privacy Protection:** DuckDuckGo does not track users' search histories or personal information, ensuring anonymity and privacy.
  
- **Search Functionality:** It offers search features similar to other search engines, including web search, image search, video search, etc.

- **Open Source:** Some parts of DuckDuckGo's code are open source, allowing people to review its workings and privacy protection mechanisms.

## Usage

- **Privacy Advocates:** DuckDuckGo is an excellent choice for users concerned about their privacy since it doesn't track search histories or personal information.

- **Researchers:** DuckDuckGo provides unbiased search results by not customizing them based on individual preferences, making it a useful tool for researchers.

- **Sensitive Topic Searches:** For searches involving sensitive topics where users may not want their search history tracked, DuckDuckGo is a good option.

## How to use
**Intall**
```
pip install -U duckduckgo_search
```
search text:
```
from duckduckgo_search import DDGS
results = DDGS().text("python programming", max_results=5)
print(results)
```
but when you use a Proxy, you should set it.
```
ddgs = DDGS(proxy="http://localhost:7891", timeout=20)
```
the '7891' is your Proxy Port.
